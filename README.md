[# Ruoting (Carlos) Yang](https://github.com/MACS-30111-23/pa00-ruoting-Y/edit/main/README.md)

Hi guys, I am Carlos from Beijing, China. I graduate from NYU and I am really familiar with Manhattan, so please reach out to me for travel/food advise. My concentration is in *Media,Culture,Gender,and censorship*. I really like visiting art museums, **MOMA** is my favorite so far, but **the art institute** is even better! 

Something about me:
- A cat person
- Lady Gaga fan
- Love everyting citrus
- Love weird fashion/architectural design
- Miss my family everyday

I am confused about how to add a picture... I guess that's the challenging part.
